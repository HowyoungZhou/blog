# Hello World

Have a look at my new blog built with modern frontend technologies! This website is built with Gatsby and Material UI. Here are some highlights:

## Generate Posts from Markdown

Posts can be written in Markdown and will be transformed to React components automatically.

## Automatic Dark Mode

Support dark mode with Material UI theme and adapt to the system setting.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

For each push on the master branch, the website will be rebuilt and push to my GitHub Page repository using GitHub Actions.

## SEO-Friendly Localization

Localization is powered by `react-i18next` and is SEO-friendly by placing the language code in the URL.
